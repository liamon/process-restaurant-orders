# process-restaurant-orders
This was a Third Year Programing assignment on topics such as synchronized multithreading in Java.
Each item on the order list is prepared by a Chef and then served by a Server.
I used NetBeans 8.2 to write the code for this.

Please note for GitHub I fixed a minor mistake of an unneeded call to `Thread.sleep` in `Server.java` which resulted in the Servers stalling for no reason when the food was ready to be served.
